##### Beginning of program (pseudocode might be too specific; most likely will break down into additional functions) #####

-Generate index dictionaries (from function 'generate_index_dictionaries'); one ('index_dict') to reference for writing to output files and check if 
index read is known; the other ('permutations_dict') to keep count of instances of read pairs (matched and unmatched)
-Use function "create_output_files" to open files to write out to while parsing the input files
-Read in four FASTQ input files containing the sequence information (2 biological reads; 2 index reads):
    -initiate counter (for line count)
    -initialize 3 additional counters for keeping track of total number of matched, index-hopped, and unknown index pairs
    -initiate lists to hold record info for each read file (2 total; forward and reverse)
    -initiate two variables to False ('swapped' and 'unknown'; keeping track of current read pair index category)
    -Iterate over each line from one of the four files:
        -Read next line for the additional three files (each file's line should match in terms of line number)
        -if current line is sequence (modulo):
            -check if index1 and index2 are present as a key in 'index_dict' and subsequently for equivalence:
                -if one or both are not in 'index_dict', change 'unknown' to True; increment total unknown counter
                -if they are both known indexes, check equivalence of index1 and rev. comp. of index2 (function 'rev_comp'); if not 
                equivalent, change 'swapped' to True; increment total swapped counter
            -append each current read line to appropriate list; add index1 and index2 (rev comp!) sequence to header line already stored in 
            the lists; increment (index1,index2) key in 'permutations_dict' (unless 'unknown' is True!)
            -add 1 to line counter; continue to next line
        -elif the current line is quality scores (modulo):
            -append quality score lines to lists holding record info
            -if 'swapped' is True:
                -check if avg quality score is at least cutoff (iterate over string and use 'convert_phred' function):
                    -if at least one index is not, change 'swapped' to False, change 'unknown' to True; decrement swapped counter; increment 
                    unknown counter
                    -if both are at least cutoff; write out full records to index-hopped output files
            -if 'unknown' is True:
                -output records info to unknown files
            -if matched indexes:
                -check if avg quality score is at least cutoff (iterate over string and use 'convert_phred' function):
                    -if at least one index is not; increment unkown counter; write out full records to unknown output files
                    -if both are of quality, increment matched counter; write out records to index specific matched files
            -add 1 to line counter
            -reset record lists and index category variables
        -else:
            -append the current line for each read file to their respective lists
            -add 1 to line counter
